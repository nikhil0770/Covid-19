    <p>
    Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common  <br>severe acute respiratory<br>
    syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In 2019, a new <br>coronavirus was identified as the cause of a<br>
    disease outbreak that originated in China.<br>
    The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 <br>(SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).<br>

    <br />
    <p>
      It's unclear exactly how contagious the new coronavirus is. It appears to spread from person to person among those in<br>
      close contact. It may be spread by respiratory droplets released when someone <br> with the virus coughs or sneezes. <br><br>
      It may also be spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes.

    <p>
      Although there is no vaccine available to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, you can take steps to reduce your
      risk of infection. WHO and CDC recommend following these precautions for avoiding COVID-19:
      </p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid large events and mass gatherings.</li>
        <li>Avoid close contact (about 6 feet) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.</li>
        <li>Keep distance between yourself and others if COVID-19 is spreading in your community, especially if you have a higher
        risk of serious illness.</li>
        <li>Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away the used tissue.</li>
        <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth if your hands aren't clean.</li>
        <li>Stay home from work, school and public areas if you're sick, unless you're going to get medical care. Avoid taking
        public transportation if you're sick.</li>
      </ul>
